This is a plugin for the Homebridge server, which maps API keys of a Signal K server to matching [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/) devices.

Use this plugin to read and in case of switches and dimmers even control your boat's devices from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV or HomePod. Having an Apple TV 4 or HomePod in your LAN you can read and control even remotely.

## General Prerequisites:
The plugin fills the gap between Homebridge and Signal K, so you need both up and running:
- [Signal K server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-server)
- [Homebridge server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge)


## Mapped API keys and devices:
The plugin maps the following [Signal K API keys](http://signalk.org/specification/1.0.0/doc/vesselsBranch.html) to suitable HomeKit devices:

### Environment
The following Signal K standard keys are mapped to temperature and humidity sensors:

/environment/outside/temperature/  
/environment/inside/temperature/  
/environment/inside/engineRoom/temperature/  
/environment/inside/mainCabin/temperature/  
/environment/inside/refrigerator/temperature/  
/environment/inside/freezer/temperature/  
/environment/inside/heating/temperature/  
/environment/water/temperature/  

/propulsion/port/temperature/  
/propulsion/starboard/temperature/  

/environment/outside/humidity/  
/environment/inside/humidity/  
/environment/inside/engineRoom/relativeHumidity/  
/environment/inside/mainCabin/relativeHumidity/  
/environment/inside/refrigerator/relativeHumidity/  
/environment/inside/freezer/relativeHumidity/  
/environment/inside/heating/relativeHumidity/  

### Tanks
The following Signal K standard keys for tanks are mapped to humidity sensors:

/tanks/*  

HomeKit does not support tank sensors yet, so a humidity sensor is the best matching device showing percentages. Tanks on low level (freshwater, fuel, lubrication, live well, gas, ballast) or high level (wastewater, blackwater) show a low battery warning.


### Batteries and Chargers
The following Signal K standard keys for batteries and chargers are mapped to humidity sensors:

/electrical/batteries/\*  
/electrical/inverterCharger/\*  

HomeKit does not support batteries as stand alone devices yet, so a humidity sensor is the best matching device showing percentages representing the state of charge. Batteries on low level show a low battery warning.

Know issue: Batteries which don't report a state of charge (SOC) to Signal K are shown in Home App as "not responding".


### EmpirBus NXT switches and dimmers
Keys generated by the [Signal K EmpirBus NXT plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-empirbusnxt-plugin) are mapped to switches and dimmers:

/electrical/switches/empirBusNxt-instance<id>-dimmer<id>/  
/electrical/switches/empirBusNxt-instance<id>-switch<id>/  

#### Prerequisite:
[Signal K EmpirBus NXT plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-empirbusnxt-plugin)


### Venus GX switches and dimmers
Keys generated by the [Signal K Venus plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-venus-plugin) are mapped to switches and dimmers:

/electrical/switches/venus-0/  
/electrical/switches/venus-1/  

Know issue: Venus GX meta data is not processed.

#### Prerequisite:
[Signal K Venus plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-venus-plugin)


### Raspberry Pi
Keys generated by the [Signal K Raspberry Pi Temperature plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-raspberry-pi-temperature) are mapped to temperature sensors:

/cpu/temperature/

#### Prerequisite:
[Signal K Raspberry Pi Temperature plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-raspberry-pi-temperature)


## Configuration
The plugin awaits and accepts the following settings in the Homebridge `config.json` file:

### Required parameters:
`"platform" : "SignalK"`  
`"host": "127.0.0.1:3000"` IP address and port of Signal K server  

### Optional parameters and their default values if omitted:
`"name" : "NameOfVessel"`  
`"ssl": false` Set to `true` if Signal K server is awaiting connections via SSL  

`"emptyBatteryVoltage" : "22.5"` Battery SOC shown as 0% (ignored if SOC is reported from battery itself)
`"lowBatteryVoltage" : "23.5"` Low battery warning if battery voltage is at or below  
`"fullBatteryVoltage" : "26.5"` Battery SOC shown as 100% (ignored if SOC is reported from battery itself)
`"chargingBatteryVoltage" : "27.5"`Battery shown as charging if battery voltage is at or above  
`"lowFreshWaterLevel" : "25.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  
`"highWasteWaterLevel" : "75.0"` Low battery warning if tank level is at or above  
`"highBlackWaterLevel" : "75.0"` Low battery warning if tank level is at or above  
`"lowFuelLevel" : "50.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  
`"lowLubricationLevel" : "50.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  
`"lowLiveWellLevel" : "50.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  
`"lowGasLevel" : "50.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  
`"lowBallastLevel" : "50.0"` Low tank (battery) warning if tank level is at or below  

`"removeDevicesNotPresent": false` If set to `true` devices which are not present in API keys (after restart of Signal K server) are removed from HomeKit (at start of Homebridge server). Set to `false` to prevent devices disappearing after rebooting Raspberry Pi if homebridge loads faster that the Signal K tree is filled.

`"ignoredPaths": ["key","key"]` List of API keys for which you don't want to have a device in HomeKit. Devices will be deleted from HomeKit if already present.  

`"displayNames": ["key":"Display Name","key":"Display Name"]` List of API keys and reespective display names to use for them in HomeKit. Saves the effort to rename them in HomeKit manually. Spaces and Umlauts are allowed.
